# AZ-305: Business Continuity

All notes taken from [the relevant AZ-305 learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/design-business-continuity-solutions/) starting point.

- **High Availability and Disaster Recovery** (HADR)

  - Recovery Time Objective: maximum time available to recover
  - Recovery Point Objective: maximum data loss after recovery
  - **IaaS HADR**
    - **SQL Server HADR**
      - **Always on Failover Cluster Instance (FCI)**
        - protects instance
        - also captures things outside the database
        - Unique-name and load balancer based
        - One database copy on shared storage (e.g. Azure Premium File Share)
        - Operating System HADR for SQL Server deployments
          - Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC)
          - Linux Pacemaker
      - **Always On Availability Group (AG)**
        - protects database
        - does not capture things outside the database
        - primary read/write replica
        - secondary replica's synchronized by transporting logs
        - Standard Edition has 1 primary + 1 secondary replica
        - Enterprise Edition has 1 primary + 8 secondary (max)
      - **Log Shipping**
        - protects database
        - oldest HADR method
        - full backup, restore on secondary, which receives log backups
    - **Virtual Machine HADR**
      - **Availability Sets**
        - Requires Internal Load Balancer (ILB)
        - Guarantees running on different physical servers
        - Fault Domain separation (hardware failures, network outages, power interruptions)
        - Update Domain separation (groups that can be rebooted together)
      - **Availability Zones**
        - Requires Internal Load Balancer (ILB)
        - Guarantees running in different data centers (same region)
        - Mutually exclusive with Availability Sets
        - Typically 1ms latency
      - **Azure Site Recovery**
        - Guarantees replica in different region
        - Monthly RTO of 2 hours
        - No transaction guarantees for VM's running SQL Server
  - **PaaS HADR**
    - SQL Server
      - Active geo-replication (Azure SQL Database)
      - Auto-failover Groups (Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Database Managed Instance)
    - Azure Database for MySQL
      - SLA: 99.99 availability
      - Node-level (e.g. hardware issues): built-in failover mechanism
    - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
      - Similar to MySQL
      - Scale-out hyperscale "Citus" is another option (creates replicas, so more expensive)
  - **Hybrid HADR**
    - Transactional Replication from on-premises to Azure SQL Managed Instance (but not other way around)
    - Availability Group between on premises and in Azure
      - needs ExpressRoute or site-to-site VPN
      - needs AD DS and DNS set up

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

  - Considerations
    - What are your workloads? (distinct, logically separate capability or task)
    - What are usage patterns? (e.g. prime time)
    - What are the availability metrics?
      - Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
      - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
    - What are the recovery metrics?
      - Recovery Time Objective (RTO), max time to recovery
      - Recovery Point Objective (RPO), max data loss
      - Recovery Level Objective (RLO), granularity of recovery
    - What workload availability targets?
      - SLA's for each workload
    - What are the SLAs?
  - **Azure Backup**
    - Backup Types
      - On-premises
        - Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent: files, folders, system state
        - System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM)
        - Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) agent: Hyper-V and VMware virtual machines
      - Azure Virtual Machines
        - Entire Machines (Windows or Linux)
        - Files, folders, and system state (with MARS agent)
      - Azure Files (to a storage account)
      - SQL Server in Azure VM's
      - SAP HANA databases in Azure VM's
      - Microsoft cloud (for on-premises or off-site backup)
    - Backup Storage
      - Vaults
        - Azure Backup vault (Azure Backup)
        - Azure Recovery Services vault (Azure Backup or Azure Site Recovery)
      - Redundancy
        - Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), for data center failures
        - Geo-redundant Storage (GRS), for region-wide outages
    - Blob backup and recovery
      - Operational Backup
        - Continuous backup
        - Specific period for restoration
        - Soft delete feature (for blobs and containers) - 1-365 days
        - Blob versioning support for automatic versions
    - Azure Files
      - Share Snapshots
        - Manual creation (portal, REST API, SDK's, Azure CLI, Powershell)
        - Automated creation (Azure Backup (recommended), backup policies)
        - Created at root, retrieval at individual file level
        - Incremental between snapshots
        - Prevents deletion of a share itself (until snapshots are deleted first)
        - Allows for
          - Instant restore
          - Alerts and reporting
          - Self-service restore (via Volume Shadow Copy Service, VSS)
          - On-demand backups can add to scheduled backups
    - Virtual Machine Backup and Recovery
      - Azure Backup
        - Specialized offering for database workloads (e.g. SQL Server)
        - Step 1 = VM Snapshot, Step 2 = snapshot into recovery services vault
        - Encrypted at rest with Storage Service Encryption (SSE)
        - Recommend at least "v2 storage" account to prevent throttling
        - Cross Region Restore (CRR) is opt-in for any Recovery Services vault.
    - Azure SQL Backup and Recovery
      - SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance
        - Full backups (every week)
        - Differential Backups (every 12-24 hours)
        - Transactional backups (every 5 to 10 minutes)
      - Restore options
        - Restore to Point-in-Time
        - Restore deleted database to time of deletion
        - Restore database to another geographic region
        - Restore database from long-term backup, if Long-Term Retention (LTR) is set up
  - **Azure Site Recovery**
    - Features
      - Replicate Azure VM's, also to a secondary region continuously
      - Replicate on-premises VM's
      - Replicate workloads
      - Automate Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) tasks
