      - Standard SSD: SSD, 750 Mbps / 6K IOPS
      - Standard HDD: HDD, 500 Mbps / 2K IOPS
    - Encryption types
      - Azure Disk Encryption (ADE): only VM has access
      - Server-Side Encryption (SSE): encryption at rest in the data center
      - Encryption at host: server hosting the VM provides encryption
  - **Azure Queue Storage** (large numbers of messages)

- **Data storage for relational data**

  - SQL Variants
    - **Azure SQL Database**
      - Pricing options
        - Database Transaction Unit (DTU) model
          - Simple, pre-configured
          - Bundled measure of compute, storage, and IO
          - Not available for Managed Instances
        - vCore model
          - Independent scalability of compute, storage, and IO
          - Flexible and transparent
          - Recommended option
        - Serverless
          - Compute tier for single databases
          - Bills only for amount of compute used
        - NOTE: Elastic Pools allow combining pricing of multiple databases
    - **Managed Instance**
      - Good for "Lift & Shift"
      - PaaS, always uses vCores mode
      - All databases share the same vCores
      - Supports SQL Server Agent
      - Supports Common language runtime (CLR)
      - Supports Database Mail
      - Supports Distributed transactions
      - Supports Machine Learning Services
      - Supports Service Broker
      - Supports Linked servers
      - **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines**
        - Full SQL Server capabilities
        - You're fully responsible for OS and SQL Server
  - **Scaling options**
    - Vertical Scaling
      - Elastic Pools
      - DTU model requires Basic, Standard, or Premium tier
      - vCore model requires General Purpose or Business Critical tier
    - Horizontal Scaling
      - Sharding: partition data across multiple SQL Databases
      - Read scale-out: partition workload across SQL Databases
      - Availability depends on database type and pricing tier
  - **Availability options**
    - General Purpose (or Standard)
      - Gateway
      - Remote storage (except tempdb for primary replica)
      - Data and log files in Azure Premium Storage (LRS), multiple copies
      - Backup files in Azure Standard Storage (RA-GRS)
      - Failover similar to FCI
    - Business Critical (or Premium)
      - Equivalent to Always On Availability Group)
      - Data and log files all on local SSD (for latency improvements)
      - Three secondary replicas
    - Hyperscale
      - Only for Azure SL Database
      - Tiered caches and page servers
      - Up to 100 TB databases
      - Snapshots for near-instantaneous backups
      - Restores take minutes (instead of hours or days)
  - **Security of Data**
    - Data at rest: Transparent data encryption (TDE)
      - Enabled for all new instances
      - Encryption at page level
      - Encryption and decryption when writing and reading from disk
      - Database Encryption Key (DEK)
        - Service-managed (built-in server certificate)
        - Customer-managed
    - Data in motion: SSL/TLS
      - optionally add VPN if communicating with on-premises
    - Data in process: Dynamic data masking
      - Policy based
      - Masks result sets of queries
      - Configured through portal, PowerShell, or REST API
  - **Azure SQL Edge**
    - Containerized Linux application, small startup memory footprint (<500MB)
    - Supports data streams in real time
    - Connected deployment with Azure IoT Edge
    - Disconnected deployment as standalone container or in a cluster
  - **Azure Cosmos DB Table Storage**
    - Single-digit millisecond response times
    - Migration from Azure Table Storage is easy (recommended)

- **Data integration**
  - **Azure Data Factory**
    - ETL data integration process
    - pipelines of ingested data into a single data store
    - Steps
      - Step 1: Connect and collect. Ingest data.
      - Step 2: Transform and enrich. E.g. with Databricks or HDInsight Hadoop.
      - Step 3: CI/CD and publishing.
      - Step 4: Monitor.
  - TODO: Work in progress.
